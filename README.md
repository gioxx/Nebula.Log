### üîç `Test-ActivityLog` in detail

This function validates the availability and write capability of a specified activity log file.

#### **Syntax**

```powershell
Test-ActivityLog -LogLocation <String> [-LogFileName <String>]
```

#### **Parameters**

- `LogLocation` (String, **Required**)  
  The directory where the log file is expected to be located.

- `LogFileName` (String, Optional)  
  The name of the log file. Defaults to `activity.log` if not specified.

- `TryFix` (Switch, Optional)  
  If the `activity.log` file is not writable, the function tries to rename the old file and create a new one where new log messages can be written.

#### **Description**

`Test-ActivityLog` checks whether the specified log file exists and is writable by the current user. If the file doesn't exist or is not writable, it returns `"KO"` and writes an error. If everything is in order, it appends a test entry and returns `"OK"`. You can also use `TryFix` switch in case the file is not writable, to attempt an automatic _repair_.

This is useful for automated checks or pre-flight validations before starting logging operations.

#### **Example**

```powershell
Test-ActivityLog -LogLocation "C:\Logs"
```

Returns `"OK"` if `C:\Logs\activity.log` exists and is writable, otherwise `"KO"`.

```powershell
Test-ActivityLog -LogLocation "C:\Logs" -TryFix
```

Try renaming the old, damaged, non-writable file so that you can create a new one in which to keep track of new log messages.

## üß™ Testing with Pester

```powershell

```

## üßΩ How to clean up old module versions (optional)

When updating from previous versions, old files (such as unused `.psm1`, `.yml`, or `LICENSE` files) are not automatically deleted.  
If you want a completely clean setup, you can remove all previous versions manually:

```powershell
# Remove all installed versions of the module
Uninstall-Module -Name Nebula.Log -AllVersions -Force

# Reinstall the latest clean version
Install-Module -Name Nebula.Log -Scope CurrentUser -Force
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è This is entirely optional ‚Äî PowerShell always uses the most recent version installed.
